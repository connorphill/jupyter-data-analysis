# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Framework
## By Connor Phillips

This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) framework that was generated from years of conducting data analysis on a wide variety of data points. It was built in a linear fashion from broad exploration to more precise groupings of data so that you don't have to jump around the notebook and lose track of the patterns you noticed along the way.
